                <h1>What is the Crypto Gram</h1>
                <p className="test animation">Gram is a global Cryptocurrency Ecosystem whose
                     members help each other to achieve financial
                      well-being using our tools and algorithm of
                     instant profit distribution on smart contracts.</p>
                    <p className="test animation" >The Crpyto Gram system belongs to our Community
                         and is fully decentralized , which means it is 
                         transparent,
                         secure and resistant to external influences.</p>
                        <p className="note test animation">A Smart contract is a self-excuting 
                            algorithm (program code). it guarantees the
                             transparency and security of 
                            executing logic or transfer within the blockchain.</p>
                            <p className="test animation">The platform Gram is open and available to everyone. 
                                The process of entering the community and starting 
                                to make a profit is so simple that you only need a 
                                laptop or a smartphone with an Internet connection. 
                                Develop matrix platforms and invite partners to the
                                 structure, for 
                                which you get remuneration in POLYGON cryptocurrencies.</p>
                                <p className="note test animation">No risk - META FORCE is different from other platforms,
                                     transactions are processed in a blockchain by a 
                                     smart contract and cannot be changed or stopped 
                                     even by the creators. Transfers go directly to 
                                     participants' personal wallets with no hidden fees
                                      or use of third-party resources. Which means that
                                       every reward earned belongs entirely
                                     to the individual and can be used immediately.
                                </p>
